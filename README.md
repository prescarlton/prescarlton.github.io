This here bad boy is a temporary home for my website, at least until I find a cheap place to buy a domain/host my site from.
At some point in the (hopefully) near future, this will also host a good amount of the projects I'm working on.
Really the only interesting project I'm working on right now is [box-set](https://github.com/prescarlton/box-set), and it isn't all that great yet.

##about me
I'm a Junior software developer from Charleston, SC. I attended the College of Charleston for two semesters, but decided it wasn't for me at the time and ultimately dropped out to pursue a career in the tech industry. I'm not living in a refridgerator box yet, so I'd say I'm doing pretty good for myself.
